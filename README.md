## Fraud Detection Auto Insurance Claims 

### Project Objective

Fraudulent claims are one of the biggest challenges facing any insurance provider. Hence, detecting fraud has not only considerable cost and profit potential for insurers, but also benefits the consumer as it will lead to lower premiums and faster processing of their insurance claims. 

In this project, I used a publicly available Automotive dataset to construct a machine learning model to predict fraudulent insurance claims.
